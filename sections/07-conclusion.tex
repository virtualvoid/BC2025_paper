\section{Conclusion}

This paper presented the design and implementation of a prototype enterprise document and records management system with integrated workflow support. 
The proposed solution combines structured classification modeling, compliance-oriented data design, and a configurable workflow engine within a modular service-based architecture.

By separating workflow definitions from execution state, incorporating version control mechanisms, and integrating auditability across core entities, 
the system provides a flexible yet controlled environment suitable for enterprise document lifecycle management. 
The architecture leverages modern backend technologies and container-based deployment principles to ensure portability and scalability.

The results demonstrate that records management and workflow orchestration can be effectively unified without compromising architectural clarity or maintainability. 
Future work will focus on enhancing lifecycle automation mechanisms, extending compliance validation features, and evaluating performance characteristics under large-scale enterprise workloads.
