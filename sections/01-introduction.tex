\section{Introduction}
Enterprise document and records management systems (DMS/RMS) play a critical role in ensuring structured storage, traceability, and lifecycle control of organizational documents. 
Modern organizations are required not only to manage digital documents efficiently, but also to comply with regulatory requirements concerning retention periods, classification schemes, disposal procedures, and auditability.

Traditional document management solutions often focus primarily on storage and retrieval, while advanced business process handling is delegated to separate workflow systems. 
This separation introduces integration complexity, data redundancy, and inconsistent lifecycle control. 
There is therefore a need for a unified approach that combines records management principles with flexible workflow execution in a single coherent architecture.

This paper presents the design and implementation of a prototype enterprise document and records management system with integrated workflow support. 
The system is built using modern architectural principles and emphasizes modularity, scalability, and compliance-oriented data modeling. 
The core contribution of this work lies in the integration of a configurable workflow engine with a structured records model reflecting hierarchical classification, retention rules, and audit requirements.

The objective of this paper is to describe the architectural design, data model, workflow engine structure, and compliance mechanisms of the proposed solution, 
and to demonstrate how these components form a consistent and extensible system suitable for enterprise environments.
