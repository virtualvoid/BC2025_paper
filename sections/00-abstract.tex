This paper presents the design and implementation of an enterprise document and records management system with integrated workflow support. 
The proposed solution addresses the need for structured management of registry records, including classification, retention policies, disposal procedures, and auditability, 
while maintaining extensibility and modern architectural principles. 
The system is based on a microservice-oriented architecture implemented in .NET, utilizing a relational database for structured metadata storage and distributed components for messaging and caching. 

A dedicated workflow engine enables the definition and execution of configurable process models, including task, decision, and scripted nodes, allowing dynamic business logic execution and versioned workflow definitions. 
The data model reflects hierarchical classification structures and regulatory requirements related to records lifecycle management. 
The implementation emphasizes modularity, traceability, and compliance with records management principles \cite{iso15489,moreq2010}.

The resulting system demonstrates that enterprise-grade document and records management functionality can be combined with flexible workflow execution within a unified architecture, 
while preserving scalability and maintainability.
